Adds features from typing-label to textramode, for effects and styles.

## License

This is based very closely on [typing-label](https://github.com/rafaskb/typing-label), by Rafa Skoberg.
Typing-label is MIT-licensed according to its repo `LICENSE` file, but (almost certainly unintentionally) does not
include any license headers in any files. Since the only requirement of the MIT license is to leave any license text
as-is, this Apache-licensed project is fully compliant with MIT. The full MIT license text is in the file
`typing-label.LICENSE`, and the Apache 2 license for this project is in the file `LICENSE`. Apache license headers are
also present in all library source files here. The Apache license does not typically apply to non-code resources in the
`src/test/resources` folder; individual fonts have their own licenses stored in that directory.
