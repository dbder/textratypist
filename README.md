# textratypist
Adds features from typing-label to textramode, for effects and styles.

This is currently an almost-exact copy of [typing-label](https://github.com/rafaskb/typing-label), by Rafa Skoberg.
Typing-label is MIT-licensed but (almost certainly unintentionally) does not include any license headers in any files.
Since the only requirement of the MIT license is to leave that license text as-is, this Apache-licensed project is fully
compliant with MIT. The full MIT license text is in the file `typing-label.LICENSE`, and the Apache 2 license for this
project (which will apply more as it changes away from being a direct copy) is in the file `LICENSE`.
